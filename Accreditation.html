                    <p class="heading-description">Accreditation is about quality assurance for various publics and ongoing improvement for theological schools, especially regarding student learning and formation. It is a voluntary process through which schools mutually assure one another’s educational quality with an eye toward ongoing improvement, based on standards. Through self-review, a school has regular opportunities to reflect intentionally on its distinctive strengths and its areas of desired growth in light of its unique mission and distinct context and in light of the standards.</p>

                    <p class="heading-description">Self-review then supports the school’s efforts in planning, evaluation, and imagination. Through peer review, an accredited school is endorsed by its peers as one of quality and integrity, which affirms the school’s value to society, as well as its trustworthiness [from Preamble to 2020 <a>Standards of Accreditation</a>].</p>

                    <p class="heading-description">If you serve as the accreditation liaison officer for your school, please visit the <a>Accrediting Liaison Officer HUB</a> for many helpful resources.</p>
