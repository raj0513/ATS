                    <p class="heading-description">The member schools of The Association of Theological Schools in the
                        United States and Canada (ATS) and the Commission on Accrediting of ATS are graduate schools of
                        theology that educate persons for the practice of ministry, for a range of church-related
                        professions, and for teaching and research in the theological disciplines. They include
                        Protestant, Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Jewish graduate schools of theology and reflect a
                        broad spectrum of doctrinal, ecclesiastical, and theological perspectives.</p>
                    <p class="heading-description">Accredited schools are members of both ATS and the Commission.
                        Associate member schools are members only of ATS. Associate members have met the membership
                        eligibility criteria and have been elected to a five-year term of membership by the member
                        schools of the Association. Degree programs are not approved by the Commission until a school
                        has attained accreditation.</p>
